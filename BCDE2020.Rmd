## Motivation:

- Beyond GDP, socio-economic variables and their convergence are relevant for development studies (Royuela et al 2015)

- Persistent income differences, differences in health indicators and in "general" regional inequality in Colombia.

- Scarce academic literature on convergence at the municipal level. 
  
## Research Objective:
  
- Study convergence/divergence of homicide rates (**NMR**) and personal injury rates (**NPIR**) across municipalities and departments in Colombia over 2010-2018. 

- Analyze spatial autocorrelation and its robustness at different disaggregation levels.
  
## Methods:

- Classical convergence framework (Barro and Sala-i-Martin 1992)

- Distributional convergence framework (Quah 1996; Hyndman et. al 1996)

- Spatial convergence (spatial lag and spatial error models)

- Spatial autocorrelation (Moran's I and differential Moran's I)

# (1) Data:

- Total number of **homicides** and **personal injuries** in Colombia per year from 2010 until 2018 (data taken from the national police).

- Data is agreggated at the municipal  and departmental levels.

- Population census and estimates for states and municipalities (data from the National Bureau of Statistics).

- Raw rates computed $$raw\space rates = crimes / population$$

- Non crime rates  computed　
   $$NCR= 10000- raw\ rate * 10000$$
- **Survival rates** are chosen because positively defined variables are a **standard** in the convergence literature.

# (2) **Global convergence:**

**Beta convergence** (catch-up process)         $log{\frac{Y_{iT}}{Y_{i0}}}=\alpha +\beta \cdot log(Y_{i0})+ \epsilon$

<img src="figs/betaexpl.png" style="width: 40%" />

**Spatial Beta models**
 
*Spatial lag Model:*　 　　 $\log \frac{Y_{i T}}{Y_{i 0}}=\alpha+\beta \cdot \log \left(Y_{i 0}\right)+\rho W \log \frac{Y_{i T}}{Y_{i 0}}+\varepsilon_{t}$

*Spatial Error Model:*         　　　　 　   $\log \frac{Y_{i T}}{Y_{i 0}}=\alpha+\beta \cdot \log \left(Y_{i 0}\right)+\lambda W \varepsilon_{t}+u_{t}$

**Sigma convergence** (the dispersion of the data decreases over time)

## Beta and sigma  convergence summary


<img src="figs/reg_table2.png" style="width: 100%" />

- **Lagrange multiplier tests** also indicate that the SEM is the best fitting model.
-  Royuela and García (2015) also reported that the $\rho$ and $\lambda$ coefficients  were **NOT significant at the state level** over the period 1990 to 2005.  
- The authors reported half-lives of **15.3, 11.5 and 15.8 years**.

# (4) Spatial Autocorrelation (Theory)

##**High Intuition Concept**   

<img src="figs/moran4.png" style="width: 70%" />


## More Formal (less intuitive)

$$I = \frac{\sum_i\sum_j w_{ij} y_i.y_j}{\sum_i y_i^2} = \frac{\sum_i (y_i \times \sum_j w_{ij} y_j)}{\sum_i y_i^2}.$$

##Differential Moran's I ( $y_{i,t}−y_{i,t−1}$ )
We compute the Moran's I  for the  variable 
$y_{i,t}−y_{i,t−1}$. 

If there is a  fixed effect  $\mu_i$ related to location $i$, it is possible to present the value at each location for time $t$ as the sum of some intrinsic value and the fixed effect. $y_{i,t} = y*_{i,t} + \mu_i$

# (4) Spatial autocorrelation  (Results)

- **State level**: Moran's I statistic is significant, differential Moran's I is not significant (**not robust**)

- **Municipal level**: Standard and Differential Moran's I significant  (**robust**)
- **Space matters at the Municipal level**

#(5) Policy discussion 

- Vertical and horizontal policy coordination, spillovers and borders.

- Spatial spillovers from neighbors can have **both positive and negative effects** on the convergence path of a region.

- It could be more appropriate for the formulation of national development plans to have targets at the state level

# (5) Concluding Remarks

## Uplifting results "on average" :

- The dispersion of non-crime (crime) rates at the state level **has decreased**. On average less homicides but more personal injuries. 

- **Global convergence on average at the state level**, while fast beta convergence at the municipality level.

## Beyond classical convergence  :

- Regional differences matter in **both disaggregation levels**.

- **Multiple local convergence clubs**; with more clubs at the state level.

## The Role of Space

- Subsequent Differential Moran's I are robust and significant at the **municipality level only**

- Results at the **state level** for NMR are not conclusive and similar to the ones reported by Royuela et al 2015.

---

# (5) Concluding Remarks

# Implications and further research

- Convergence clusters help us to find regions with similar outcomes, coordination among them can be promoted.

- Strong spatial autocorrelation suggest the possibility of applying spatial filters in order to remove the spatial component of crime variables.  

- At the state level (including more variables) a probit model may help us to find the determinants for a conditional "jump" to the upper clusters.

- As many municipalities have small population, crime rates have high  variance instability. Empirical Bayes methods can be used.
